# Guess The Celebrity - Android Studio App 
The cool thing about this app is that it uses an external webpage to download the content that will make the app work. The app uses this webpage https://www.imdb.com/list/ls052283250/ and downloads in a background task the .html file then using a Regex we filter and get the names and the image links of the celebrities and store then in an ArrayList.
